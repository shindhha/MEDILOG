Yet Another Simple MVC Framework (for PHP)


## Context

This project has been designed in the context of computer science course in a French curriculum 
called "DUT Informatique".

The course is about Web Server development with PHP. 

## Disclaimer

The project has only been tested in small to medium academic projects.  

In addition, the designer (I), is not a PHP guy but more a Java/Kotlin guy who is used to work with 
frameworks like Spring Boot. It may introduce some bias into the design.
